 * Audio sinks can be many things, such as a file, sound card, network stream,
 * etc.
 *
 * We aim to simplify this experience by providing frameworks for different

/**
 * @brief Sink module, base class for outputting audio data
 *
 * A sink is a component that consumes audio data,
 * allowing audio data to leave the chain.
 * How it goes about consuming audio data varies greatly,
 * but can include sending audio to a sound card, file,
 * network stream, ect.
 * These components are usually the last modules in the chain,
 * also know as right most or forward most modules.
 *
 * Sink modules usually have the functionality to manage the entire
 * module chain, sampling each module and outputting it
 * for you, so the user does not have to.
 *
 * We offer some helper methods for outputting audio data to
 * various backends.
 *
 * The most common functionality is the concept of periods.
 * A 'period' is a chunk of audio.
 * Some backends utilize periods to split up their output buffers,
 * so instead of generating one large chunk of audio,
 * we generate many smaller chunks of audio that are then outputted.
 * We offer methods to change the period,
 * and we automatically handle it for you.
 *
 * We should also figure out how to handle the issue of specifying
 * differing sample rates, channel numbers, ect.
