 *
 * In digital audio, an 'envelope' describes how a parameter of a sound changes
 * over time. For use in MAEC, you can think of an envelope as a value that
 * changes over time. Each envelope does not necessarily have to alter a
 * component of a sound, but most of the time they will be used to do so.
 *
 * MAEC exposes these envelopes as AudioModules,
 * meaning they can be linked and worked with like any other module.
 * It is not recommended to use these to generate audio data to work with!
 * Instead, use the outputs from these envelopes to modulate the
 * parameter of another module.

/**
 * @brief Base class for all envelopes
 *
 * This class provides some common functionality for all envelopes.
 * Mainly, we provide a timer that can be utilized by certain envelopes,
 * as well as certain values that can aid with timekeeping.
 *
 * This envelope helps keep sub-envelopes aware of certain parameters
 * that are necessary for a value to change over time,
 * that being the:
 *
 * - start_time - Time this envelope starts
 * - stop_time - Time this envelope stops
 * - value_start - The starting value
 * - value_stop - The stopping value
 *
 * These values allow for any basic envelope to be implemented properly.
 * High level envelopes (such a ChainEnvelope or ADSREnvelope) will likely NOT
 * implement these values, and will instead work with low-level envelopes such
 * as these.
 * TODO: Figure this out
 *
 * It is not recommended to use ANY envelopes for generating audio data!
 * Instead, these modules should be used to modulate the parameter of other
 * modules.
