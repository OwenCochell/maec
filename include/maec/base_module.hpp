/**
 * @brief Represents a module
 *
 * This class offers a framework for modules,
 * allowing them to be worked with and managed by higher level components.
 * This component will be used to represent all modules in maec,
 * and contains some functionality that ALL modules should utilize and
 * implement!
 *
 * A "module" is a class that has the following properties:
 *  1. Has a state (unloaded, loaded, started, stopped)
 *  2. Has processing methods (process, meta_process)
 *  3. Has state methods (start, stop, finish, done)
 *  4. Has info sync methods
 *  5. Has chain traversal methods (forward / backward)
 *  6. Has buffer exchange methods
 *  2. Can be utilized by module collections
 *  3. Inherits this class
 *
 * Modules should be designed to do one thing,
 * and do it well!
 * This is optional, as a single module could do many things,
 * but it is recommended to follow this suggestion.
 *
 * Each module has a state it can be in:
 *
 * Created -> Started -> Running -> Finishing -> Finished -> Stopped
 *
 *  - Created - Module has been created
 *  - Started - Module has been started, and will start working with data
 *  - Running - Module is currently running and working with audio data
 *  - Finishing - Module has been requested to stop, and should do any necessary
 * operations
 *  - Stopped - Module has been stopped and will no longer work with data
 *
 * The state can be identified by using the 'get_state()' method.
 * The state will automatically be set by each module as it is used.
 *
 * We also contain state methods that are called when necessary,
 * checkout 'start()', 'stop()', 'finish()', ect. for more info.

     * Again, modules can overload this method and preform any action here.
     * As a note for users, if one wants to alter the AudioInfo,
